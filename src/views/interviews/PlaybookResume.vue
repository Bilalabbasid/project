            To even get an interview for a Front End Engineer position, we have
            to submit a resume that passes the company's resume screening
            process. There are many existing resources out there to help you
            craft a good Software Engineer resume but few are tailored towards
            Front End Engineers. For general Software Engineer resume tips,
            refer to Tech Interview Handbook.
          </p>

          <p>
            On this page, we provide some front end-specific tips to help Front
            End Engineers improve their resumes and get to the interview stage.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h2>Basic requirements</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Preferably kept under one page if you have less than 5 years of
                experience, not exceeding two pages
              </li>
              <li>
                Build using Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Pages, or LaTeX so that
                Applicant Tracking System (ATS) can parse the resumes. Avoid
                using design software
              </li>
              <li>Submit in PDF format</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Formatting and aesthetics</h2>

            <p>
              Front End Engineers deal with user interfaces frequently and are
              expected to have a keen sense of design. It will reflect very
              poorly on you as a Front End Engineer if your resume isn't
              aesthetically pleasing.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Use a single-column format</li>
              <li>
                Use common fonts which are available on most operating systems
                like Arial, Calibri, or Garamond. Avoid fancy fonts
              </li>
              <li>
                Stick to a single or at most two fonts (one font for headings
                and another for the body)
              </li>
              <li>Minimum font size of 11px</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Your resume doesn't need to be super pretty and fancy, it just
              needs to look neat and visually pleasing. If you have cash to
              spare, the quickest way to create an aesthetically pleasing and
              ATS-friendly resume is to purchase resume templates from FAANG
              Tech Leads.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Work experience section</h2>

            <p>
              The work experience section of your resume is the most important
              and should take up the majority of the space on your resume. It is
              important to highlight your contributions to your past or current
              employer's business goals in this section.
            </p>

            <p>
              To improve ATS ranking of your resume, sprinkle "Front End" across
              your resume where possible. If your official title is "Software
              Engineer" but you have been doing a significant amount of front
              end development as part of your job, consider putting your title
              as "Front End Engineer" / "Front End Software Engineer" /
              "Software Engineer (Front End)" instead to improve the relevance.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is common for people to make the mistake of not providing
              enough details about their experiences and achievements. To stand
              out, it is important to provide sufficient information about the
              scale, complexity, and impact of your experiences and
              achievements.
            </p>

            <div class="example-box">
              <p>
                <strong>Bad 👎:</strong> "Built a website with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript"
              </p>

                <strong>Better 👍:</strong> "Built a performant e-commerce

            </div>

            <p>
              Here's a non-exhaustive list of front end-related technical

                <strong>Product work:</strong> Elaborate on the features built

                <strong>Performance:</strong> Performance improvements made and
                the resulting gains in percentage. E.g. page load size, page

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Testing:</strong> Number of tests written, how many

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Accessibility (a11y):</strong> Number of a11y errors

                <strong>Tooling:</strong> Modernizing of technologies used in a
                code base, e.g. migrating a jQuery code base to React, improving
                typesafety by introducing TypeScript. Either describe the
                product or mention rough number of LOCs/engineers working on the
                code to give a better sense of the scale and complexity
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Skills section</h2>

            <p>
              The "Skills" section is a list of languages and technologies you
              possess and serves as a quick checklist/summary when
              ATS/recruiters/hiring managers read this section. At the minimum,
              you should have two list items for the "Languages" and
              "Technologies" categories:
            </p>

            <p>
              Due to the huge number of different technologies that are required
              to build front end applications, you might find that you have many
              technologies to add into the skills section of your resume.
              However, do not add every technology! This dilutes the weight of
              the skills that actually matter. Prioritize the
              languages/technologies that:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Appear in the job listing</h3>
            <p>
              If a skill appears in the job listing and you have experience with
              it, you should definitely add it in.
            </p>

            <h3>
              2. List only key technologies that influence the architecture
            </h3>
            <p>
              Libraries like React heavily influence the other accompanying
              technology choices while libraries like Underscore/Lodash are
              architecture-agnostic and can easily be swapped out. Prioritize
              the former and omit small/utility libraries that are easily
              replaceable.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Widely known or are rapidly gaining popularity</h3>
            <p>
              This shows that you keep up with the modern front end ecosystem.
              The company might also be considering moving towards that
              technology and if you are experienced in that it's a plus.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Demonstrate your breadth</h3>
            <p>
              Listing all of React, Angular, and Vue (all front end view
              frameworks) is overkill even if you are indeed familiar with all
              of them. Few job listings will list more than one technology that
              serves the same purpose (and it's a red flag if they do). Adding
              too many technologies (especially of the same category) makes it
              harder for the reader to get a sense of your skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              Try to list at least one and at most two technologies that belong
              to the following categories. Not all categories will apply to you,
              so only include the relevant ones. Popular examples are shown
              below.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>JavaScript libraries:</strong> React, Angular, Vue,
                Svelte
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Metaframeworks:</strong> Next.js, Gatsby, Nuxt,
                SvelteKit
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>State Management:</strong> Redux, Flux, Jotai, Zustand,
                Relay
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CSS:</strong> CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind
                CSS, Sass, Less
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CSS frameworks:</strong> Bootstrap, MUI, Chakra UI,
                Bulma
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Unit testing:</strong> Jest, Vitest, Storybook, Mocha,
                Jasmine, Karma
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data fetching:</strong> GraphQL, tRPC, TanStack Query,
                swr
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Integration testing:</strong> Cypress, Selenium,
                Puppeteer, WebdriverIO, Playwright
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Language tooling:</strong> Babel, TypeScript, Flow,
                ESLint
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Build tools (optional):</strong> webpack, Vite, Parcel,
                Gulp, Rollup, Browserify
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Package management (optional):</strong> npm, Yarn, pnpm
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>
              This would be how the "Skills" section on our resume looks like:
            </p>

            <div class="example-box">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Languages:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Technologies:</strong> React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS,
                  Jest, Storybook, Cypress, React Query, Yarn, webpack
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              This is exactly the technology stack used to build GreatFrontEnd.
              You should definitely have HTML, CSS, JavaScript under your
              "Languages" item, otherwise there's something hugely wrong.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Projects section</h2>

            <p>
              The front end domain advances pretty fast with new JavaScript
              frameworks and CSS methodologies emerging every year. Having
              projects on your resume suggests that you are passionate about the
              field and put in the extra effort to up with latest front end
              technologies especially if they are not used at your job, which is
              a huge positive signal. List down the technologies used for each
              project especially if they are modern technologies that the
              company uses. It helps with ATS ranking and leaving a deeper
              impression on the reader. Where possible, put the code on GitHub
              and polish up the README with screenshots of the product. Add
              links to the project's code and live website into your resume.
            </p>

            <p>
              Open source contributions, especially non-trivial changes to
              complex code bases are seen as a sign of technical competency.
              Even better if you have created or are a maintainer of open source
              projects.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p>
              While Tech Interview Handbook's general Software Engineer resume
              tips are mostly sufficient for Front End Engineers, the tips above
              will help you to elevate your Front End Engineer resume and bring
              it to the next level.
