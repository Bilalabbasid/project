            As mentioned in our behavioral interview preparation overview,
            collaboration is one of the 8 main categories of questions to
            prepare for. Collaboration questions are probably the most common
            behavioral questions asked in front end behavioral interviews, as
            they encompass a large number of related traits which can be grouped
            for ease of story/project preparation.

            <h2>Evaluation criteria in detail</h2>

            <p>
              When rating candidates under this category, interviewers are often
              looking at the following criteria:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>Handling disagreements</li>
              <li>Working as a team</li>
              <li>Working with diverse personalities and skills</li>
              <li>Conveying complex ideas simply</li>
              <li>Giving constructive feedback</li>
              <li>Active listening</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Abstracting collaboration questions</h2>

            <p>
              As mentioned in our behavioral interview preparation overview, it
              is impractical to prepare answers specifically for every
              behavioral question out there. However, by batching specific
              questions into similar themes and preparing stories that cover a
              large number of question requirements, we can reduce the number of
              stories to prepare to around 3-5 stories.
            </p>

            <p>
              Collaboration is such a theme which can group sub-requirements
              like communication, team work, adaptability and coachability. For
              each sub-requirement, we have summarized the common questions and
              also abstracted out the traits that interviewers are looking out
              for across these questions:

            <h2>Suggested answer framework</h2>

            <p>
              As always, the STAR format is the simplest and most effective
              framework that we recommend to structure your story.
            </p>

            <p>
              Based on the abstraction above, we can see that interviewers are
              looking for specific traits for every sub-requirement. We have
              created a quick cheatsheet for suggested approaches to exhibit
              these desired traits.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ideally, you should select stories that can cover as much of the
              below traits as possible, so that you don't have to remember too
              many stories.

                There's a conflict of interest between business/design and

                demands or requirements with them to see if any could be dropped
                for faster engineering delivery. Additionally, you catered for

            <p>Here's a sample story using the STAR format.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
              <h4>Situation</h4>
              <p>
                In my current job as front end engineer in a startup, I had to
                lead development on a highly urgent marketing project, working
                cross functionally with marketing and design. At some point,
                marketing had expected the feature to ship within the next week,
                but there was a significant roadblock from engineering due to
                dependencies on a partner API team whose deliverables were
                delayed due to recent departures of two senior members. The
                situation had become heated as marketing did not understand the
                roadblocks engineering had faced.

                In order to do so, I spoke to marketing privately and gave them
                time to clearly explain the urgency and concerns or
                misconceptions marketing might have towards engineering. I then
                explained the role of the partner teams, focusing specifically
                on their impact on the feature as opposed to complex technical
                information. In doing so, we were able to brainstorm different
                ways we could ship the feature even without the external
                dependencies. In parallel, I also spoke to the partner team's
                manager on the importance of the project to the company and the
                possibility of reprioritizing their work to help unblock us.
                Apart from that, I also solicited feedback on how engineering
                could better collaborate with marketing to avoid such
                misunderstandings in future.

              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>
                Due to the tight collaboration between engineering and
                marketing, we were able to ship the feature in a timely manner.
                As marketing prioritized timelines and accountability, we
                started providing regular updates and discussed alternatives for
                every potential blocker. With this, every feature was
                successfully and smoothly delivered there after.

            <h2>Possible nature of follow-up questions</h2>

            <p>
              As mentioned in our behavioral interview preparation overview,
              interviewers are encouraged to rely more on follow-up questions to
              really understand the candidate's thought process and motivations,
              which typically fall under these categories:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>Why do you think you did (insert action)?</li>
              <li>Why did you not do (insert action)?</li>
              <li>How would you do things differently in hindsight?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              For questions on collaboration, interviewers will most likely
              probe for questions to help them understand a bit more about:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>
                Understanding if and why certain stakeholders were involved or
                not involved
                <ul class="nested-list">
                  <li>
                    Which stakeholders were involved in the discussion, and why?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Why were certain stakeholders like (insert stakeholder)
                    excluded from the group?
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Understanding group dynamics and how it affected the strategy to
                handle the group
                <ul class="nested-list">
                  <li>
                    Which personalities were present in the group and how did it

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Did this understanding affect your strategy to navigate
                    group discussions?
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Understanding the candidate's mindset to conflict

                  <li>
                    How do you think conflicts like this affect the working

              </li>
              <li>
                Understanding how the resolution was derived; did the candidate

                  <li>
                    Were there any data and information which were leveraged in

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Was there an analysis of each solution's pros and cons?

              <p>
                You could answer the question with a slight modification of the
                sample story, focused on the explanation of the technical
                information:

                <p>
                  "To ensure that my message is well understood, after
                  explaining, I will provide a few examples to illustrate my
                  points and also ask my audience a few questions to confirm
                  their understanding. In a project I did a few months ago, I
                  had to explain to the business team why and how an urgent
                  feature had been delayed by external team API delays. To do
                  so, I focused on the key takeaways that business needed —
                  which was how the feature was impacted by such a delay, and
                  utilized visual aids as well as used simple and clear
                  language. I also gave examples while asking questions to
                  ascertain their understanding of my explanation. This allowed
                  the business team to understand the dependency well enough to
                  brainstorm ways to deliver the feature even without the
                  dependencies."

                  For instance, I had a teammate on a project who had missed bug
                  fix timelines regularly, and once it happened a number of
                  times, I scheduled a private meeting with him to talk to them
                  about it. I focused on framing the conversation as a growth
                  opportunity for him on top of what is already appreciated
                  about them, which was his knowledge and mentorship as a senior
                  developer. Instead of describing a general behavior such as
                  "being late", I mentioned the specific tickets that were
                  missed and the impact that had occurred from missing them, as
                  well as its effect on the morale of the team. I then offered a
                  few solutions, such as enacting a new reminder bot within the
                  channel for tickets that were due soon. He was able to
                  understand where I was coming from and our team was able to
                  meet our deadlines much better after that."
