            Behavioral interviews are designed to assess how you've handled
            situations in the past as an indicator of how you'll perform in the
            future. Unlike technical interviews that test your knowledge and
            problem-solving abilities, behavioral interviews focus on your soft
            skills, communication, and real-world experience.

            <h2>What are behavioral interviews?</h2>

            <p>
              Behavioral interviews are a common interview format where
              interviewers ask candidates to describe specific situations from
              their past work experience. The premise is that past behavior is
              the best predictor of future performance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Instead of asking hypothetical questions like "How would you
              handle a difficult team member?", behavioral questions ask for
              concrete examples: "Tell me about a time when you had to deal with
              a difficult team member."
            </p>

            <div class="principle-section">
              <h4>Why do companies use behavioral interviews?</h4>

              <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Predict future performance:</strong> Past behavior
                  patterns are reliable indicators of future actions
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Assess soft skills:</strong> Technical skills can be
                  taught, but soft skills like communication and leadership are
                  harder to develop
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reduce bias:</strong> Structured behavioral questions
                  provide a consistent framework for evaluating candidates
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Legal protection:</strong> Behavioral questions focus
                  on job-related experiences rather than personal
                  characteristics
                </li>

            <h2>The STAR method</h2>

            <p>
              The STAR method is the most effective framework for answering
              behavioral questions. STAR stands for:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Situation:</strong> Set the context and background
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Task:</strong> Describe your specific responsibility
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Action:</strong> Explain what you did and how you did it
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Result:</strong> Share the outcome and what you learned
              </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="code-block">
              <pre><code>Example: "Tell me about a time you failed"

Situation: "In my previous role as a frontend developer, I was tasked with implementing a new user authentication system for our e-commerce platform."

Task: "I had to integrate OAuth with our existing user database and ensure the system could handle 10,000 concurrent users during peak shopping hours."

Action: "I started by researching OAuth best practices and reviewing our current authentication flow. I implemented the OAuth integration using a third-party library, but I didn't thoroughly test the edge cases. When we deployed to production, users experienced login failures during high traffic periods."

Result: "The system failed during our biggest sales event, causing significant user frustration. I immediately rolled back the changes, implemented proper error handling and load testing, and redeployed a more robust solution. This experience taught me the importance of comprehensive testing and having rollback plans."</code></pre>

              Notice how this answer provides a complete picture: what happened,
              what the person did, and what they learned. This demonstrates both

              <h4>1. Review your experience</h4>
              <p>
                Before your interview, spend time reflecting on your past
                experiences. Make a list of 5-10 significant accomplishments and
                challenges from your career. For each one, note:

              <p>
                Prepare answers for the most common behavioral questions.
                Practice speaking out loud and time yourself to ensure your
                answers are concise (1-2 minutes each).

                Structure all your answers using the STAR framework. This
                ensures you provide complete, well-organized responses.

              <h4>4. Prepare questions for the interviewer</h4>
              <p>
                Behavioral interviews often end with "Do you have any questions
                for us?" Prepare thoughtful questions that show your interest in
                the role and company.
