            The self introduction is one of the things you can always expect to
            encounter in an interview, regardless of interview format. Hence the
            return on investment of preparing for it is rather high. Most of the
            time, your self introduction should be short and sweet, delivering a
            good impression in the fewest amount of words.

          <section>
            <h2>Recommended Preparation</h2>

            <p>
              In essence, you should always prepare a self introduction that is
              under 1 min in almost all cases.
            </p>

            <p>
              Prior to the interview, it is best to understand more about the
              evaluation criteria for the round from a recruiter or hiring
              manager — specifically if you will be evaluated on behavioral/fit
              aspects or purely on technical criteria. In big tech companies,
              coding rounds may totally exclude behavioral related criteria,
              hence your self introduction will most likely just serve as a
              "warm-up" to the main interview.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, in behavioral interviews or technical interviews in a
              startup or a company which prioritizes practical experience over
              LeetCode-style interviews, you may want to extend your self
              introduction to a quick portfolio showcase, or allude to the fact
              that you have a portfolio of your projects that they could view
              after the interview or allocate around 5 min at the end of the
              interview to run through.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, do note that in whichever case, if you are doing coding
              interviews with fixed format in the round, you should keep your
              self introduction short to ensure that you have more time on the
              actual coding test. Any extra time you take on your self
              introduction will be taken away from the time you have to answer
              technical questions.
            </p>

            <p>
              To tackle all the possible cases, you should prepare a 1-min pitch
              and a project portfolio (optional but recommended).

            <div class="subsection">
              <h3>The big picture</h3>

              <p>Most of the time, pitches will cover these 4 items:</p>

              <ol class="numbered-list">
                <li>Breadth and depth of job experience</li>
                <li>Top achievements</li>
                <li>
                  If less than 5 years of working experience, educational
                  background
                </li>
                <li>Motivation for applying for role</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                When developing your pitch, keep the objective in mind — you
                want to leave a good first impression as a potential ideal
                candidate for the role. To do this, you should come off as
                confident and likable, on top of demonstrating key requirements
                of the role. Think about what you would look out for if you were
                to hire a candidate for this role.
              </p>

              <p>
                Do not attempt to go too deep — focus on covering the main
                points and enunciating them confidently and smoothly. As
                software engineers, we prove our mettle through projects and
                code. Talking too much too early may come off as over-eager and
                words alone don't hold much value.
              </p>

              <p>
                In essence, to hiring managers, the self introduction serves to
                answer these questions about the candidate for them:
              </p>

              <ol class="numbered-list">
                <li>
                  Is this candidate passionate about front end / software
                  engineering?
                </li>
                <li>Can they describe things in a clear and concise way?</li>
                <li>What kind of person are they? Confident or arrogant?</li>
                <li>
                  Would I want to work with this person? Do they seem coachable?
